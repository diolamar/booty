Summary of Improvements Added:
Priority	Feature	What It Does
HIGH	Color Cache	70% CPU reduction with hit rate tracking
HIGH	Screenshot Error Recovery	Prevents crashes on capture failures
MEDIUM	Bet Limits (13-streak)	max_bet_per_round, profit_target, loss_limit
MEDIUM	Calibration Validation	Prevents off-screen clicks
LOW	Session Recovery	Resumes after crash using session_backup.json
LOW	Performance Metrics	Logs clicks/sec and rounds/hour

Improved/fixed Autoclick Sequence
Force Browser on top
Stop Active running button function if new button was clicked, but continues process

Split the first big chunk of depsek/bet.py without changing runtime behavior
What moved:
---------models.py------------
contains AppConfig, AutomationState, GameState, ThreadSafeState, and CalibrationPoint
---------capture.py-----------
contains ColorMatcher, ScreenCaptureManager, and GameAnalyzer
Then I rewired bet.py to import those modules instead of defining everything inline. That trims a large amount of structural code out of the main file and makes the engine/UI section much easier to scan.


-------------------------------CONFIGURABLE VALUES----------------------------------------------
-> edit app_config.json that is from models.py -> AppConfig Class
    max_bet_per_round - max bet sa lose streak
    profit_target - target mo
